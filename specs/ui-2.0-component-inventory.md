# UI 2.0 Component Inventory and Implementation Map

Source PRD: `UI-2.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PRD.md`
Design reference: [Plumy UI 2.0 Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/xK22WyMtqAJLx21eZr3QqS/Plumy?node-id=26-175)
Task: `task-e2c057ab-d2f7-4cb9-bcaa-e98603d64c19`

## Purpose

This inventory verifies the current componentization state before UI 2.0 layout work begins. The goal is to separate safe layout/component extraction from visual restyling, identify reusable primitives, and list the visual states that need to be design-ready before each implementation slice is marked done.

## Current State Summary

The app already has useful surface-level composition, but most panel and dialog surfaces still mix layout, local UI state, data formatting, copy/export helpers, and domain behavior inside large components.

| Area | Current file(s) | Current shape | UI 2.0 posture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App panel orchestration | `src/app/components/AppPanels.tsx` | Central mount point for task, milestone, people, and preferences panels. Prop-heavy but valuable as a transition boundary. | Reusable as the migration host. Add new panel components here before deleting old ones. |
| Main views | `src/app/components/AppMainViews.tsx` | Clean view switcher for Timeline, Kanban, Roadmap. | Reusable as-is. Keep view switching behavior stable. |
| Settings/preferences | `src/app/components/PreferencesPanel.tsx` | One large `Sheet` with task load, MCP listener/security/testing/activity, and storage controls. | Needs extraction into anchored sections. Highest-value first migration target. |
| People and agents | `src/app/components/PeoplePanel.tsx` | One large `Sheet` with person create/edit cards, load badges, agent instructions, and agent board watch controls. | Split into People/Agents settings sections. Move board-watch controls into Tasks settings. |
| Task edit | `src/app/components/TaskDialog.tsx` | Large dialog with form state, project/milestone/dependency logic, attachments, and footer actions. Already partly styled toward UI 2.0. | Reuse form logic initially; wrap in anchored panel shell later. Extract sections after Settings proves the primitive. |
| Task details | `src/app/components/TaskDetailsDialog.tsx` | Dialog with summary grid, projects, markdown description, attachments, comments, copy, and agent review action. | Good candidate for detail/read-only anchored panel sections. |
| Kanban | `src/app/components/KanbanView.tsx`, `SwimlanesView.tsx`, `DroppableColumn.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx` | Modular by board/column/card, with drag/reorder and filter logic spread across view/column components. | Mostly visual refresh after inventory. Keep behavior in place. |
| Timeline | `src/app/components/TimelineView.tsx` and timeline subcomponents | Most modular view, but `TimelineView` still owns scroll, sizing, persistence, virtualization, drag resize, and mode state. | Visual refresh and later layout extraction; avoid moving logic before anchored panel work is proven. |
| Milestones/Roadmap | `src/app/components/RoadmapView.tsx`, `MilestoneDialog.tsx`, `MilestoneDetailsDialog.tsx` | Roadmap has timeline/chart helpers and filters. Dialogs have summary/link/dependency sections. | Secondary rollout after core panels; extract reusable milestone cards/sections if styling work repeats. |

## Recommended Implementation Sequence

1. Build shared anchored panel primitives.
2. Migrate Settings to anchored sections, including moving board watch controls into Tasks settings.
3. Componentize People and Agents cards/editors and mount them as Settings sections.
4. Reuse the anchored panel shell for Task Details and Task Edit.
5. Refresh Kanban styling with existing board/column/card behavior intact.
6. Refresh Timeline styling with existing timeline behavior intact.
7. Roll out shared styling to Milestones, dialogs, empty states, and diagnostics.
8. Run visual readiness QA and create follow-up tasks for any missed states.

## Shared Primitives to Add

### `AnchoredPanel`

New primitive. Owns the common panel layout used by Settings, task details, task edit, and later object panels.

Responsibilities:
- Render a left navigation rail and a right scroll region.
- Provide Back/Close behavior.
- Support a stable `initialAnchor`.
- Expose active section state.
- Avoid feature-specific behavior.

Required states:
- Back/Close default, hover, focus.
- Left nav default, active, hover, focus, disabled.
- Long section content.
- Empty section content.
- Bottom action bar without content overlap.

### `AnchoredPanelNav`

New primitive. Renders grouped navigation items.

Responsibilities:
- Render grouped nav sections such as Settings, Storage, Help.
- Scroll to owned section anchors.
- Keep keyboard focus usable.
- Allow direct People and Agents entry points to open Settings at the right anchor.

### `AnchoredPanelScrollView`

New primitive. Owns the scroll container.

Responsibilities:
- Ensure there is one primary scroll container.
- Avoid nested scroll conflicts except for intentionally bounded logs/code blocks.
- Provide section registration/scroll behavior to `AnchoredPanel`.

### `AnchoredPanelSection`

New primitive. Section wrapper for title, description, and content.

Responsibilities:
- Provide stable section ids.
- Provide accessible labels.
- Preserve predictable spacing between sections.

## Settings Inventory

Primary source: `src/app/components/PreferencesPanel.tsx`

### Current Componentization

`PreferencesPanel` is a 780-line component that currently owns:

- `src/app/components/KanbanView.tsx`
- `src/app/components/SwimlanesView.tsx`
- `src/app/components/DroppableColumn.tsx`
- `src/app/components/TaskCard.tsx`

- `SwimlanesView` owns column drag/reorder state and filtered-board empty state.
- `DroppableColumn` owns column header, edit dialog trigger, add-task row, task drop indicators, and task list rendering.
- `TaskCard` is already a reusable card presentation component.

### Extraction Candidates

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `KanbanToolbar` | component | Extract before styling | Search, filters, clear actions, add board. |
| `KanbanScrollFrame` | component/hook | Extract later | Custom scrollbar and scroll metrics are behavior-sensitive. |
| `KanbanColumn` | rename/extract | Wrap `DroppableColumn` | Keep drag/drop behavior intact. |
| `KanbanColumnHeader` | component | Extract during visual refresh | Header title, count, color strip/edit action. |
| `KanbanAddTaskRow` | component | Extract | Useful for empty and populated columns. |
| `KanbanTaskCard` | component | Reuse `TaskCard` with styling updates | Current card already handles checklist preview and project pills. |

### Behavior to Preserve

- Task reorder within a column.
- Column reorder.
- Column edit/delete/color change.
- Filter persistence and sanitization.
- Search plus project/priority/assignee filters.

## Timeline Inventory

Primary sources:
- `src/app/components/TimelineView.tsx`
- `src/app/components/TimelineHeader.tsx`
- `src/app/components/DraggableSwimlaneRow.tsx`
- `src/app/components/DraggableTimelineTask.tsx`
- `src/app/components/DraggableSwimlaneLabel.tsx`
- `src/app/components/SwimlaneRowsView.tsx`
- `src/app/components/MonthsScrollerFixed.tsx`

### Current Componentization

Timeline is the most modular primary view, but the container is still large. `TimelineView` owns:
- Left column width persistence.
- Month width persistence.
- Projects/people mode state.
- Weekend visibility.
- Horizontal and vertical scroll coordination.
- Startup scroll-to-today behavior.
- Task resize state.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TimelineToolbar` | component | Extract during visual refresh | Mode toggle, weekend toggle, add project/person controls if applicable. |
| `TimelineLayoutProvider` | hook/provider | Later | Owns left column width, month widths, scroll state. |
| `TimelineGridFrame` | component | Later | Header/rows/scroll container wiring. |
| `TimelineRowList` | existing | Reuse | `SwimlaneRowsView` and row components are already useful. |
| `TimelineTaskBar` | existing | Reuse | `DraggableTimelineTask` is the correct behavior boundary. |
| `TimelineSwimlaneNav` | existing | Reuse | `DraggableSwimlaneLabel` should keep reorder behavior. |

### Behavior to Preserve

- Drag-to-resize task dates.
- Drag/drop task across timeline rows.
- Reorder project rows and people rows.
- Scroll synchronization between header and rows.
- Startup scroll to today.
- Left column resize.
- Month resize.
- Weekend visibility.

## Milestones and Secondary Surfaces Inventory

Primary sources:
- `src/app/components/RoadmapView.tsx`
- `src/app/components/MilestoneDialog.tsx`
- `src/app/components/MilestoneDetailsDialog.tsx`
- `src/app/components/ColumnDialog.tsx`
- `src/app/components/SwimlaneDialog.tsx`

### Current Componentization

Roadmap is functional but heavy. It owns search/filter state, date-window filtering, chart layout, scrub scrolling, month header grouping, milestone row layout, and task dependency ordering.

Milestone dialogs are more focused but still contain extractable sections for project selection, task linking, dependency editing, summary, late-task warnings, and linked task lists.

### Extraction Candidates

| Candidate | Type | Recommendation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RoadmapToolbar` | component | Extract during secondary rollout | Search, project, health, date filters, add milestone. |
| `RoadmapChart` | component | Extract later | Chart layout is behavior-sensitive. |
| `MilestoneSummaryCard` | component | Extract | Reusable in details and roadmap. |
| `MilestoneLinkedTasksSection` | section | Extract | Details view and edit flow both need linked-task display. |
| `MilestoneTaskLinker` | component | Extract from dialog | Search, selection, and dependency controls. |
| `MilestoneDependencyEditor` | component | Extract carefully | Dependency behavior must stay scoped to linked milestone tasks. |
| `SharedDialogFooter` | component | Extract if repetition increases | Delete/save/cancel patterns across dialogs. |

### Behavior to Preserve

- Roadmap filters and reset behavior.
- Roadmap scroll-to-today and header scrub.
- Milestone date range and health calculation.
- Linked task composition.
- Late-task detection.
- Task linking and unlinking.
- Dependency edits between linked tasks.

### Visual Readiness States

- Roadmap empty.
- Roadmap filtered empty.
- Populated roadmap with multiple milestones.
- Milestone at risk, complete, planned, no tasks.
- Milestone details with no linked tasks.
- Milestone details with late tasks.
- Milestone create/edit validation.
- Linked task dependency states.
- Shared destructive dialog actions.

## First Adoption Target

Start with Settings.

Reasons:
- It is the clearest match for the UI 2.0 anchored navigation design.
- It contains multiple natural sections.
- It has direct People/Agents/Tasks/MCP/Data/MCP Activity/MCP Testing anchors.
- It lets the new `AnchoredPanel` primitive mature before touching task dialogs.
- Moving Agent Board Watch into Tasks settings resolves the main information architecture change early.

Recommended first implementation milestone:

1. Add `AnchoredPanel` primitives with a small fixture/example inside Settings only.
2. Create `SettingsPanel` that renders the same behavior as `PreferencesPanel`.
3. Extract `TasksSettingsSection`.
4. Move `AgentBoardWatchSettings` from `PeoplePanel` into `TasksSettingsSection`.
5. Extract `McpSettingsSection`, `McpActivitySettingsSection`, `McpTestingSettingsSection`, and `DataSettingsSection`.
6. Add `PeopleSettingsSection` and `AgentsSettingsSection`.
7. Keep direct header People and Settings buttons, but route People/Agents buttons to Settings anchors once equivalent behavior is verified.

## Behavior-Sensitive Paths

Do not change these in the same commit as pure layout extraction unless required:

- MCP listener/token/capability profile persistence and restart behavior.
- MCP audit log copy/export.
- Storage import/export and local data purge.
- Agent watch poll/save/reset runtime behavior.
- Person add/edit/delete and `agentInstructions` persistence.
- Task attachment pick/verify/reveal.
- Task dependency cycle prevention.
- Task/milestone link and dependency updates.
- Kanban drag/drop and column reorder.
- Timeline task resize, row reorder, scroll sync, and persisted widths.

## Componentization Tags

Use these tags when creating follow-up implementation tasks:

- `reusable-as-is`: `AppMainViews`, `AppPanels` as transition host, `TaskCard`, timeline row/task subcomponents.
- `reusable-with-wrapper`: `DroppableColumn`, `TaskDialog` form logic, `TaskDetailsDialog` sections, milestone details sections.
- `needs-extraction`: `PreferencesPanel` sections, `PeoplePanel` cards/editors, `KanbanToolbar`, `RoadmapToolbar`, task details/edit sections.
- `new-primitive`: `AnchoredPanel`, `AnchoredPanelNav`, `AnchoredPanelScrollView`, `AnchoredPanelSection`.
- `defer`: `TimelineLayoutProvider`, `KanbanScrollFrame`, `RoadmapChart` until the visible rollout proves the new panel/layout primitives.

## Completion Criteria for This Inventory

- Current componentization state is mapped.
- Reusable, wrapper, extraction, and new primitive candidates are tagged.
- Behavior-sensitive paths are listed before refactor work starts.
- Settings is confirmed as the first anchored-panel adoption target.
- Visual readiness states are listed for Settings, People/Agents, task panels, Kanban, Timeline, and Milestones.
